Ideas:
- Page animated transitions by shifting content up and down to mimic “looking up and down” at the stars
- kinda interested in playing and seeing if motion graphics could also be done (gsap)

To Do:
- Find 12 sounds
	- something that matches each characteristic of corresponding constellation
	- wind/wind chimes
- Body copy information for each constellation
- Starry background of the entire website
- Telescope image
- Hi fidelity wireframes
